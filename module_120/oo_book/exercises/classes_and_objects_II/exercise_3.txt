When running the following code...

class Person
  attr_reader :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

bob = Person.new("Steve")
bob.name = "Bob"

We get the following error...

test.rb:9:in `<main>': undefined method `name=' for
  #<Person:0x007fef41838a28 @name="Steve"> (NoMethodError)

Why do we get this error and how to we fix it?

Answer: 
We get this error because the attribute is setted only for reading through the method 'attr_reader', meaning that
only a getter method for 'name' attribute is available for objects of this class. To fix it, we have to change the
method from attr_reader to attr_accessor, or attr_writer.
