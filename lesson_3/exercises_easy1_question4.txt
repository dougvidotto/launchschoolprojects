The Ruby Array class has several methods for removing items from the array. Two of them have very similar names. Let's see how they differ:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
What do the following method calls do (assume we reset numbers to the original array between method calls)?

numbers.delete_at(1)
numbers.delete(1)

Answer:
.numbers.delete_at(1)
=> In this case, it will delete the second item at numbers array (item 2). The remaining items would be: [1, 3, 4, 5]

.numbers.delete(1)
=> Delete the 1 item. In this case, the result would be: [2, 3, 4, 5]
