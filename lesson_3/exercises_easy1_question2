Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

what is != and where should you use it?
put ! before something, like !user_name
put ! after something, like words.uniq!
put ? before something
put ? after something
put !! before something, like !!user_name



Answer:
'!' is used, as a common pattern, at the end of methods, indicating the caller is being modified.
Also, '!' is used to change a boolean value from true to false or false to true.

. what is != and where should you use it?
=> This symbol means different. Usually is used when comparing values in a if clause

.put ! before something, like !user_name
=> Alter the boolean equivalent value of user_name. If is nil, the equivalent is false, then changes to true
  If is not nil, then equivalent is true, and '!' changes to false.

.put ! after something, like words.uniq!
=> Used in methods like 'words', it's a pattern meaning the caller, word, is being modified

.put ? before something
=> In this case is the beggining of a ternary operator.

.put ? after something
=> After a method, it's a pattern indicating that method returns true or false

.put !! before something, like !!user_name
=> It returns the boolean equivalent of that variable.
