ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>

  Answer: It's saying that we are calling calculate_product method passing just 1 argument besides 2 that was waiting for.
